I'm Henry Fleischer, a student programmer at RTC and an ametur game developer!

Ultimately, my goals as a programmer are to be able to develop games, and make small programs to aid in worldbuilding. Because of this, I lean towards learning core programming concepts, and I'm more interested in eventually learning calculus and vector math than, say, web development frameworks. My main interests as far as game development goes are in First Person Shooters and Shoot Em' Ups, although I have a minor interst in action platformers and strategy games.

I am somewhat compotent in Ruby and C#, and have a moderate understanding of the Godot game engine. I also have about three years experience using Blender regularly. I've been taking a 2-year computer science course at Renton Technical College, and I'm about 2/3rds of the way through the core classes.

My current main personal project is an [FPS](https://github.com/NotNewAnymore/FPS1) I'm working on in Godot 4.2.1. I started this project with a goal of making a very slow movemnt shooter, but it's ended up being a very momentum-based game with no enemies so far. The hardest part was getting the movement to work properly, particulary around walls- I still don't know vector math, so I ended up applying some math I learned in a statistics class in high school instead, which i was able to get to mostly work properly.

My most useful repository has been this space [habitat habitable area calculator](https://github.com/NotNewAnymore/Hab-area-calculator), it can be used to calculate the surface area of both spherical and cylendrical space habitats, with multiple floors, taking into account machine space as seen on skyscrapers.

Another project I'm somewhat proud of, despite how old it is, is this [Shmup](https://github.com/NotNewAnymore/Test2). This was the first time I actually tried developing a game in Godot, and at the time I had no real understanding of the engine. Because of that, the whole game was built around a very strange data structure, which was mostly unrelated to the engine, just using the engine to display what's going on, meaning it would be relatively easy to port to another engine. I also implemented my own collision code, and the bullets use some pretty strange code for movement, which does not read their position at any time. Ultimately, this informed my greater use of engine features in the fps I'm currently working on, although I ended up pretty much copiying the animation system I developed for the Shmup into the FPS.
