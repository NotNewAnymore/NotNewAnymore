I'm Henry Fleischer, a student programmer at RTC and an ametur game developer!

Ultimately, my goals as a programmer are to be able to develop games, and make small programs to aid in worldbuilding. Because of this, I lean towards learning core programming concepts, and I'm more interested in eventually learning calculus and vector math than, say, web development frameworks. My main interests as far as game development goes are in First Person Shooters and Shoot Em' Ups, although I have a minor interst in action platformers and strategy games.

I am somewhat compotent in Ruby and C#, and have a moderate understanding of the Godot game engine. I also have about three years experience using Blender regularly.
